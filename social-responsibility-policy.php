                            <h2>Social Responsibility Policy</h2>
                
                <p>As a company operating in the unique blues of our planet, we know the value of the beauties we have, and we care about every corner and every member of nature that we are a part of. As Turkon Line, we believe that we should make this world beautiful and grow kindness and hope for the next generations!</p>
                
                <p>In this direction, we carry out all our activities with the ethical principles we have. We are enriching our activities day by day with the respect for human rights, social values and beliefs, with our nature-friendly approaches, and with the importance we attach to human welfare and health.</p>
                
                <p>We know that our industry has a great responsibility in the fight against the climate crisis. In this sense, we contribute to social responsibility activities in the fight against marine pollution and the protection of marine life, and we take measures to reduce carbon emissions in the seas. We highly value the education of future generations, and we are very happy to share our knowledge and experience in the seminars organized for the young people who want to operate in our sector, and to prepare them for business life within the scope of our internship program.<br>
                We believe that corporate social responsibility projects are one of the most important issues for a corporation to establish strong communication with its target audience and to create brand awareness. We shape our social responsibility policies with this belief and the sense of responsibility that comes from being one of the important actors of global trade, and in this field, we continue to improve ourselves day by day.</p>
